# cloudwalk

## Introduction.

A sample stock trading app.

 - Select from a list of global stocks and view its details.
 - Handle authentication.

Challenges.

 - Api (Polygon.io) had limitations on whats freely accessible. Getting tickers for instance wasn't. So sample dummy lists where used instead.
 From this list, the app then makes calls to individual symbols endpoint for details.
 - Api has a tiny limit on how may request can be made per minute.
